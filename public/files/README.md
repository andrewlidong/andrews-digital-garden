Welcome to my digital garden! I'm a software developer passionate about coding, technology, and creating meaningful projects. This space is where I cultivate and share my ideas, experiences, and learnings. Feel free to explore and discover what's growing here.

I strongly believe in the power of community - from student council all the way back in middle school to hosting Socratica sessions now, creating spaces and opportunities for people to connect face-to-face as human beings drives innovation, purpose, and happiness.

Some recent projects:

- Organized a sold-out student film festival at my favourite local theatre
- Mario Kart with the soundtrack played by a live band
- Friend-nominated dating algorithms
- Created a short film in 6 weeks for buildspace
- Ran a summer camp for adults
- Built an RPG party game about organizing a hackathon (for a hackathon)

Hope you enjoy your stay - plenty of hidden goodies to find
