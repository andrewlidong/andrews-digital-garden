### Development Process
Moonshine was developed to address the limitations of traditional financial systems by leveraging blockchain technology. The project began with extensive research into existing DeFi protocols and identifying opportunities for innovation.

The smart contracts were written in Solidity and thoroughly audited for security vulnerabilities. The development process included rigorous testing on Ethereum testnets before deployment to the mainnet. Hardhat was used as the development environment to streamline the testing and deployment process.

The frontend is built with React and Web3.js, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the blockchain. Special attention was paid to creating an intuitive experience that abstracts away the complexity of blockchain interactions while maintaining transparency about transaction details.

One of the most challenging aspects was ensuring the security of user funds while maintaining the decentralized nature of the platform. This required implementing multiple layers of security measures and conducting extensive security audits.
