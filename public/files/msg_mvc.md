### Development Process
MSG MVC was born out of frustration with the complexity and overhead of existing PHP frameworks. The goal was to create a framework that provides the essential features needed for modern web development while maintaining a small footprint and high performance.

The framework follows the MVC pattern, separating business logic, data access, and presentation layers. This separation of concerns makes applications built with MSG MVC easier to maintain and extend.

One of the key design principles was to avoid unnecessary dependencies and keep the core lightweight. The framework includes only essential components, with additional functionality available through plugins. This approach allows developers to include only what they need, resulting in faster applications with smaller memory footprints.

The development process included extensive performance testing and optimization, ensuring that MSG MVC outperforms many popular frameworks in terms of request handling speed and memory usage.
