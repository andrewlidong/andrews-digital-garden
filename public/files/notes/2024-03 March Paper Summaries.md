Meetup 007 - Vector Similarity Search (March 13, 2024)
1. Accelerating Large-Scale Inference with Anisotropic Vector Quantization (2019)
	1. This paper explores vector similarity search, a crucial technique for recommendation systems, search engines, and ML models.  It introduces Anisotropic Vector Quantization (AVQ), which improves approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search performance while maintaining high accuracy.  AVQ optimizes quantization distortion to enhance large-scale inference efficiency, making it relevant for real-time applications like semantic search and NLP.  

Meetup 008 - Xen and the Art of Virtualization (2003) (March 27, 2024)
1. Xen and the Art of Virtualization (2003)
	1. This seminal paper on virtualization introduces Xen, an early and efficient hypervisor that pioneered paravirtualization.  It highlights the challenges of virtualizing x86 processors at the time, particularly the lack of software-managed TLBs and the need for OS modifications to run efficiently on Xen.  The paper set the foundation for modern cloud computing and VM-based infrastructure.  

Inside the Infamous Mirai IoT Botnet: A Retrospective Analysis
- This analysis delves into Mirai, one of the most notorious IoT botnets, which exploited weak security in internet-connected devices to launch massive DDoS attacks.  The paper explores its infection methodology, command-and-control architecture, and long-term impact on cybersecurity.  It also discusses countermeasures and how the attack highlighted systemic vulnerabilities in IoT security.
