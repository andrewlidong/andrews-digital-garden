Meetup 012 - Dynamo: Facebook's Data Center-Wide Power Management System
- Dynamo is Facebook's large-scale power management system that dynamically adjusts power usage across its global data centers.  It optimizes power allocation to balance server workloads, cooling efficiency, and overall energy consumption.  The paper discusses its use of real-time power monitoring, workload scheduling, and automated response mechanisms to reduce operational costs and improve sustainability.  

Meetup 013 - LZ4 Compression Algorithm on FPGA
- LZ4 is a lightweight, lossless compression algorithm known for its high compression/decompression speed with reasonable ratios.  This paper explores implementing LZ4 on FPGA to enhance hardware acceleration, reducing CPU overhead while maintaining low latency.  The approach is beneficial for high-throughput applications like storage, network traffic compression, and real-time data processing.  

Meetup 014 - What is Asymmetric Numerical Systems?  (May 31, 2024)
- Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) is a modern entropy coding technique used in data compression (e.g., Zstandard, JPEG XL).  It improves on Huffman and arithmetic coding by offering near-optimal compression efficiency with lower computational overhead.  ANS is widely adopted in real-time applications due to its speed and adaptability in probabilistic modeling.
