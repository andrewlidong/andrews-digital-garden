Meetup 026- Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General RL Algorithm (2017)
- This DeepMind paper extends AlphaGo's reinforcement learning framework to chess and shogi, introducing AlphaZero.  It: 
	- Uses self-play reinforcement learning instead of handcrafted rules
	- Learns strategies from scratch via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and deep neural networks
	- Demonstrates superhuman performance in chess and shogi without prior game-specific knowledge

Meetup 027 - Twine: A Unified Cluster Management System for Shared Infrastructure
- Twine is a cluster management system designed to efficiently allocate resources across multiple applications and frameworks in a shared infrastructure.  it:
	- Balances batch and latency-sensitive jobs on the same hardware
	- Improves scheduling efficiency by using machine learning models
	- Handles multi-framework resource sharing, supporting Hadoop, Spark, and Kubernetes workloads

Meetup 028 - Remus: High Availability via Asynchronous Virtual Machine Replication (2015)
- Remus is a fault-tolerant virtualization system that replicates running virtual machines asynchronously, ensuring near-instantaneous failover in case of hardware failure.  It:
	- Buffers network traffic to maintain consistency across replicas
	- Uses speculative execution to minimize performance overhead
	- Provides high availability with minimal downtime compared to checkpoint-based solutions

Meetup 029 - Large-scale Cluster Management at Google with Borg
- This seminal paper details Borg, Google's highly scalable cluster manager, which efficiently schedules and manages workloads across thousands of machines.  Key features include:
	- Bin packing algorithms for optimal resource utilization
	- Preemptive scheduling to prioritize high-importance jobs
	- Fault-tolerance mechanisms for automatic workload recovery
	- Resource isolation techniques, influencing later systems like Kubernetes

Meetup 030 - Borg: The Next Generation
- This follow-up to Google's Borg cluster manager explores the evolution of large-scale cluster scheduling, likely discussing improvements made beyond the original Borg system (which inspired Kubernetes).  It covers
	- Better resource utilization and scheduling optimizations
	- Integration of machine learning workloads
	- Handling multi-tenancy and priority-based scheduling
