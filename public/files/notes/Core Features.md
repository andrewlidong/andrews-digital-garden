- End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) using strong cryptographic protocols
- User Authentication (phone number, email, or decentralized identity)
- Messaging (1:1 and Group Chats) with text, images, and voice messages
- Push Notifications for new messages
- Cross-Device Syncing (optional but complex)
- User Privacy (no metadata leakage, self-destructing messages, etc.)

Tech Stack: 
Frontend (Mobile App)
- React Native (JS/TypeScript) - Cross-platform development
- Flutter (Dart)
- Swift (iOS) / Kotlin (Android) - Native development (more control).

Backend (Optional)
- Node.js (Express, Fastify) or Deno - If you need a server for metadata.  
- Firebase - Serverless option for authentication and messaging.  
- Self-Hosted Server - If you want full control.  

Database
- PostgreSQL/MySQL - If using a traditional backend.  
- Firestore/DynamoDB - NoSQL options for real-time data.  
- SQLite (on-device) - If storing messages locally.  

Implement End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
- Signal Protocol (WhatsApp, Signal)
- OMEMO (for XMPP-based messaging)
- Double Ratchet Algorithm

Recommended libraries: 
- libsodium (C library with JS, Swift, and Kotlin bindings)
- TweetNaCl.js (Lightweight cryptographic library)
- Signal Protocol Library (official implementation)

Build the Core Messaging System
1. User Authentication
	1. Firebase Auth, OAuth, or a decentralized identity solution
2. Message Encryption
	1. Encrypt messages before sending and decrypt on the recipient's device.  
3. Message Storage
	1. Store only encrypted messages in the database or use peer-to-peer storage.  
4. Message Delivery
	1. WebSockets for real-time updates
	2. Push notifications for offline delivery

Ensure Privacy and Security
- Zero-Knowledge Architecture - The server shouldn't access user data.  
- Forward Secrecy - New encryption keys for each session.  
- Metadata protection - Minimize data leaks (use Tor, mix networks)
- Self-Destructing Messages - Auto-delete feature for added privacy.  

Testing & Deployment
- Unit & Integration Tests - Jest, Mocha, or native test frameworks.  
- Security Audits - Get cryptograph experts to review your code.  
- App Store Deployment - Follow Apple/Google security guidelines

1. Decide on your encryption method (Signal Protocol is a great choice). 
2. Choose your frontend framework (React Native or Flutter are good starting points)
3. Set up a basic chat UI using Firebase or a simple backend.  
4. Implement end-to-end encryption for message transmission.  
5. Build & Test security features to ensure privacy.  

High Level Architecture
[React Native App] <--> [Backend (Optional)] <--> [Database (Optional)]

Since Signal Protocol handles E2EE, the backend (if used) should only store encrypted messages and metadata while minimizing exposure.  

Frontend (React Native)

Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo or Bare Workflow)
- TypeScript (for better maintainability)
- Signal Protocol Library (via @signalapp/libsignal-protocol-typescript)
- React Navigation for app structure
- Redux or Zusand (for state management)

Flow
- User registers & generates encryption keys
- Keys are stored securely on-device (AsyncStorage/SecureStore)
- User starts a chat:
	- Messages are encrypted on the sender's device
	- Only the recipient can decrypt them
- Messages are sent via Firebase (or another backend) but remain encrypted.  

Backend Options
Since E2EE means no server should be able to read messages, we have two options:
1. Firebase (Serverless)
	1. Pros: No backend maintenance, built-in authentication, real-time messaging
	2. Cons: Some metadata is still stored in Firebase (e.g. sender/receiver IDs)
	3. Implementation:
		1. Firebase Authentication (phone/email login)
		2. Firestore Realtime DB (stores encrypted messages)
		3. Cloud Functions (optional for notification handling)
