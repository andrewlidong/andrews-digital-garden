JavaScript is a high-level interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to websites.  It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS

Key Features:
1. Interpreted & Dynamic - No need for compilation, and variable types are determined at runtime.  
2. Event-Driven - It can respond to user actions (e.g. clicks, keyboard input). 
3. Asynchronous & Non-Blocking - Supports async operations via callbacks, promises, and async/await
4. Prototype-Based Object Orientation - Uses prototypes instead of classical classes for object inheritance
5. Multi-Paradigm - Supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming.  
6. Single-Threaded with an Event Loop - Uses an event-driven architecture to handle concurrency efficiently.  

Where is JavaScript Used?  
1. Web Development - Used in browsers to create dynamic content.  
2. Backend Development - With Node.js, JavaScript can run on servers.  
3. Mobile App Development - Frameworks like React Native and Ionic allow JS to build mobile apps
4. Game Development - Libraries like Phaser.js help create browser-based games.  
5. Machine Learning & AI - Libraries like TensorFlow.js enable AI-powered applications in browsers.
