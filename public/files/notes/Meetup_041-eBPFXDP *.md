# Fast Packet Processing with eBPF and XDP

## Overview

**eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** and **XDP (eXpress Data Path)** are tools for efficient network packet processing in Linux. They enable fast, programmable packet processing directly within the kernel, offering dynamic adaptability and high performance.

---

## Key Concepts

### eBPF

- **Purpose**: Modify and program kernel behavior dynamically.
- **Features**:
    - Write programs in C or P4.
    - Compile to eBPF instructions for execution in the kernel or programmable devices (e.g., SmartNICs).
    - Provides a flexible, event-driven framework for packet processing and system monitoring.

### XDP

- **Purpose**: High-performance packet processing at the network driver level.
- **Features**:
    - Operates at the lowest layer of the Linux network stack.
    - Executes programs before memory allocation, reducing overhead.
    - Ideal for DDoS mitigation, packet filtering, and rapid decision-making.

---

## Use Cases

- **Network Monitoring**: Real-time data collection and analysis.
- **Traffic Manipulation**: Filtering, dropping, and redirecting packets.
- **Load Balancing**: Efficient resource distribution.
- **System Profiling**: Kernel-level performance insights.

---

## Technical Architecture

### Workflow

1. **Write Program**: Code in restricted C.
2. **Compile**: Use the Clang compiler to generate eBPF bytecode.
3. **Verification**: Kernel ensures safety and security (e.g., bounded loops, memory bounds).
4. **Execution**: Programs run in the kernel or offloaded to hardware (e.g., SmartNICs).

### Modes of Operation

- **XDP Native**: Executes in the driver for maximum performance.
- **XDP Generic**: Emulated in software for compatibility.
- **XDP Offload**: Executes on programmable NICs for enhanced speed.

---

## Advantages

- **Performance**: Minimal overhead for high-throughput applications.
- **Flexibility**: Runtime modification of behavior without kernel recompilation.
- **Safety**: Programs are verified for security and stability.
- **Adoption**: Used by major companies like Facebook and Cloudflare.

---

## Challenges and Limitations

- Restricted C environment:
    - Limited libraries and syscalls.
    - Bounded loops only.
    - Stack size limited to 512 bytes.
- Verifier requirements:
    - Programs must pass static analysis for safety.
- Compatibility:
    - Requires specific kernel versions and driver support.

---

## Comparison: XDP vs. TC (Traffic Control)

- **XDP**:
    - Processes packets at the driver level (ingress traffic only).
    - Faster throughput, fewer resources needed.
- **TC**:
    - Works with both ingress and egress traffic.
    - Offers richer context via pre-parsed packet data.

---

## Examples

- **TCP Filter**: Drop non-TCP packets using XDP.
- **Statistics Collector**: Count packets per protocol using eBPF maps.
- **Combined Use**: Use XDP and TC together for comprehensive packet handling.

---

## Tools and Development

- **Compilation**: Clang compiler for eBPF programs.
- **Libraries**: `libbpf` for user-space interaction.
- **Debugging Tools**: Tools like `bpftool` for program inspection.

---

## Applications and Future Directions

- **Research**: Open-source projects and academic studies.
- **Industry**: Deployed in data centers, cloud platforms, and high-speed networks.
- **Evolution**: Expanding use cases and increasing hardware support.

### **1. Introduction**

- **Motivation**: Increased internet traffic and complex data center services require faster packet processing and adaptability.
- **Challenges**: Traditional networking approaches rely on static hardware implementations, making them less flexible for dynamic demands.
- **Solutions**:
    - **eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)**: Adds programmability within the Linux kernel.
    - **XDP (eXpress Data Path)**: Optimizes packet processing at the network driver level.
- **Adoption**: Technologies like eBPF and XDP are widely used for network monitoring, traffic handling, load balancing, and system profiling.

---

### **2. eBPF System**

- **Overview**: eBPF allows developers to write programs in restricted C, compile them to bytecode, and load them dynamically into the kernel.
- **Components**:
    - **Compiler**: Clang generates eBPF bytecode.
    - **Verifier**: Ensures program safety, checking for bounded loops, valid memory access, and more.
    - **JIT Processor**: Converts bytecode to native machine code for execution.
- **Limitations**:
    - Restricted C usage (e.g., no `printf()`, limited stack size of 512 bytes).
    - Programs must adhere to strict verifier rules.

---

### **3. eBPF Programs**

- **Execution**: Programs are attached to kernel hooks and execute in response to registered events (e.g., packet arrival).
- **Program Types**:
    - Examples include socket filtering, traffic classification, tracing, and tunneling.
    - Program type determines available helper functions and context.
- **Maps**:
    - eBPF uses key-value stores called **maps** for data persistence and sharing.
    - Map types include hash maps, arrays, and LRU-based structures.
    - Maps can be pinned to the filesystem for persistence beyond program lifetimes.
- **Helper Functions**:
    - Kernel provides predefined functions for tasks like checksum recalculation and packet redirection.
    - Example: `bpf_map_update_elem()` for updating map entries.
- **Tail Calls**: Programs can call other eBPF programs dynamically without returning, enabling modular and efficient designs.

### **4. Network Hooks**

#### **4.1 Overview**

- **Hooks**: eBPF programs can be attached to network hooks for packet interception.
- **Focus Hooks**:
    - **XDP**: Fastest hook, operating at the network driver level (ingress only).
    - **Traffic Control (TC)**: Processes ingress and egress traffic closer to the NIC.

#### **4.2 eXpress Data Path (XDP)**

- **Operation**:
    - Processes packets in the network driver before they enter the kernel stack.
    - Designed for high-performance use cases like DDoS mitigation.
- **Actions**: Program return codes determine packet outcomes:
    - Drop, pass, transmit, or redirect packets.
- **Modes**:
    - **Native**: Runs directly in the driver for maximum performance.
    - **Generic**: Runs in the kernel for compatibility but with reduced performance.
    - **Offload**: Executes on programmable NICs for enhanced speed.

#### **4.3 Traffic Control (TC)**

- **Features**:
    - Processes packets in both ingress and egress directions.
    - Provides richer context compared to XDP (e.g., parsed packet metadata).
- **Actions**:
    - Similar to XDP but also includes actions for restarting classification or continuing in the queue.

#### **4.4 Comparison**

- **XDP**:
    - Faster due to early interception.
    - Limited to ingress traffic.
- **TC**:
    - More flexible, processes both ingress and egress.
    - Slightly slower due to packet metadata parsing.

### **5. Examples**

#### **5.1 TCP Filter**

- **Objective**: Only allow packets containing IPv4 TCP segments.
- **Implementation**:
    - Check Ethernet and IP headers for validity.
    - Drop non-TCP packets using XDP.
- **eBPF Bytecode**: Compiles into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for optimized execution.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - Bounds checking is mandatory for all packet data access to pass the verifier.
    - Each byte is checked once unless the packet is modified.

#### **5.2 User-Kernel Interaction**

- **Objective**: Collect per-protocol packet statistics using maps.
- **Implementation**:
    - Kernel: Uses eBPF to count packets by protocol type and stores data in a map.
    - User Space: Queries the map and loads eBPF programs dynamically via `libbpf`.

#### **5.3 Combined Use**

- Example of using XDP and TC together to handle ingress and egress traffic efficiently, demonstrating their complementary strengths.
