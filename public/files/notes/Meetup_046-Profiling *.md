# **Profiling a Warehouse-Scale Computer**

## **Abstract**

- **Problem:** Understanding interactions between server applications and microarchitecture in Warehouse-Scale Computers (WSCs) is critical for optimizing performance.
- **Approach:** Detailed microarchitectural analysis of live data-center workloads measured across 20,000+ Google machines over three years, encompassing thousands of applications.
- **Findings:**
    - WSC workloads are diverse, requiring architectures tolerant of variability.
    - Common tasks ("datacenter tax") account for ~30% of cycles, presenting opportunities for hardware specialization.
    - Workloads are memory latency-sensitive, frequently experience core stalls, and show large instruction cache bottlenecks.

## **Introduction**

- **Context:** Cloud computing and WSCs have emerged as essential computing paradigms, powering applications like SaaS and IoT backends.
- **Motivation:** Small improvements in WSC performance yield immense cost savings, but limited studies have analyzed at-scale deployments.
- **Focus:** The study emphasizes microarchitecture-level analysis, particularly server processors, as a key determinant of WSC power and performance.

## **Methodology**

### **Data Collection**

- Leveraged **Google-Wide Profiling (GWP)** for low-overhead sampling of live workloads.
    - Random sampling of machines and time.
    - Performance data stored in a **Dremel database** for large-scale analysis.

### **Performance Analysis**

- Used **Top-Down Methodology** to decompose pipeline inefficiencies:
    - Categories: Retiring (useful work), Front-end bound, Back-end bound, Bad speculation.
    - Detailed cycle and instruction counts to quantify overheads.

## **Findings**

### **1. Workload Diversity**

- **Observations:**
    - No "killer app" dominates; the top 50 binaries only account for ~60% of cycles.
    - Workload diversity increased over time, with cycles distributed across more applications.
- **Implications:**
    - Optimization must target common low-level functions rather than individual applications.

### **2. Datacenter Tax**

- **Components:**
    - Protocol buffer management, RPCs, hashing, compression, memory allocation, and data movement.
    - Consistently accounts for 22–27% of execution cycles.
- **Opportunities:**
    - Hardware accelerators for components like protobuf serialization, compression, and data movement.

### **3. Microarchitectural Bottlenecks**

#### **Front-End Bottlenecks**

- Instruction cache miss rates are 5-20 MPKI, significantly higher than traditional workloads.
- Causes include:
    - Large instruction footprints due to statically linked binaries (~100MB+).
    - Competing cache usage by data streams.

#### **Back-End Bottlenecks**

- Dominant source of stalls (50–60% of cycles):
    - Memory latency is more critical than bandwidth.
    - Cache-bound cycles are prevalent, with low extracted instruction-level parallelism (ILP).

#### **Low IPC**

- WSC applications exhibit low instructions-per-cycle (IPC), similar to memory-bound benchmarks like SPEC 429.mcf.

## **Performance Optimization Opportunities**

1. **Instruction Cache Improvements:**
    - Larger caches, advanced prefetchers, and partitioning between instruction and data streams.
2. **Memory Hierarchy Enhancements:**
    - Trade memory bandwidth for lower latency.
    - Prioritize latency optimization in new architectures.
3. **Hardware Accelerators:**
    - Specialized units for common "datacenter tax" components like compression and RPCs.
4. **SMT Extensions:**
    - Wider simultaneous multithreading (SMT) to absorb cache stalls and improve front-end utilization.

## **Future Directions**

- Extend profiling methodologies to batch workloads like MapReduce.
- Develop adaptive architectures supporting dynamic workload diversity.
- Investigate long-term trends correlating application development velocity with architectural demands.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Key Takeaways:**
    - WSC workloads require architectures tailored to variability and memory latency sensitivity.
    - Optimization of common components offers higher returns than targeting individual application hotspots.
    - Microarchitectural insights inform future processor and system designs for WSCs.
