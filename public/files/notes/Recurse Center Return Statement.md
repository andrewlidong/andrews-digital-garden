  # Recurse Center Return Statement

  I've been carrying around imposter syndrome like a chef's knife I never learned to properly hold - always
there, a little dangerous, never quite fitting into my hand. Going from restaurants to engineering wasn't
  some romantic pivot story about following my passion. The truth is I needed a job after leaving Daniel,
  something that would make me employable and help me stop being this black sheep living in Manhattan amongst
  its white collar ivy league professionals. And I also wasn't one of these Recursers who grew up loving
  computers; I just wanted work that made sense.

  Getting my first programming job was brutal. Even now, sitting pretty close to a staff engineering title,
  this imposter branded knife still sits in my bag. But sometimes - when I'm helping a junior debug a docker
  build issue or when I ship something that actually impresses people - I get a temporary reprieve. I still
  remember at Recurse presenting my data storage engine at half-baked demo-day and hearing Richard (someone I
  genuinely look up to) go "wow" when I showed off the compaction feature. That meant a lot to me.

  ## My Time at RC

  My time at RC was beautifully chaotic. I built a sorting octopus in Elixir to help people find their
  Hogwarts houses (I still want to generate new houses along with lore at some point), a terrible database in
  Rust called Keystone Light that's not as funny as it sounds, a quantum computing Pokemon Safari Zone
  inspired game using Qisket and Grover's algorithm, a flight simulator with OpenGL, and probably a dozen
  other things that made perfect sense in the space. I was the person at the dinner table asking people "what
  would you be looking for in a monogamous relationshipâ€¦ with a programming language" (thanks Overheard at
  RC). I flirted with OCaml, Haskell, Rust, Gleam, Elm, and Tomo - collecting languages like some people
  collect vintage cookware.

  But honestly? The projects were just the excuse to be part of the most loving technical community I've ever
  experienced. Bruce patiently helped me get Tomo working on my Mac and taught me his beautiful new language.
  Richard helped deobfuscate the JVM and virtual threading to me. Won pushed me to add load testing to my
  storage engine and gave me advice on how to approach my new job. Conner showed me how small, bite-sized
  projects could build real confidence, starting from a tic tac toe app. When I fell into a funk mid-batch
  (breakup plus emergency move into a coliving space), Xin reminded me to actually ask for support and be
  honest in check-ins, while Kris told me to take it easy on myself. This is what a community should feel
  like.

  **RC was the best thing I've ever done for myself in tech, full stop.**

  ## What's Next

  After never-graduate week, I started at an AI fintech startup in New York. I'm still chasing that RC energy
  nights and weekends - wanting to dive deeper into Zig, Elm and OCaml, figure out how to make TypeScript
  monorepos actually scale, maybe contribute to SerenityOS, learn Nix properly, and eventually make it to MIT
  Swapfest for some hardware inspiration and self-hosting projects.

  Here's the thing that RC gave me that I didn't expect: it bridged the gap between how I felt about food and
  software. Food had always been something I loved that didn't make sense as a job. Software had always been a
   job that didn't make sense to me personally. But meeting people who are so obviously, deeply passionate
  about code - and who were willing to share that passion - made me want to become one of those people.
  Engineering is now one of my three core priorities, right alongside spiritual and physical well-being.

  I guess what I'm saying is: RC taught me that you don't have to grow up loving computers to end up loving
  what they can do. Sometimes the best relationships start as practical arrangements and become something you
  can't imagine living without.
