For me, step 3 is really about letting go of my obsessions and being open to paths other than the squirrelly ones my brain cooks up.  Logical next step to the work on accepting the insanity in step 2.  Accepting that I’m insane, and my life gets unmanageable when I give in to my obsessions/defects/insanity, and that I don’t want my life to be unmanageable anymore, for me it’s a commitment to consciously try and let the compulsion to act on the squirrels go and do something else.  The thing you’re doing now of accepting that your codependency is triggered by these tenets and doing something other than digging in is AWESOME step three work.  For work to do, maybe write down a few examples of where you have done that or could have done that or want to do that 

I think for step 3 I’ll collect my list of insanity and unmanageability and for each one write what acting what my natural response is and write what turning it over to God might look like. 

Unmanageability: 

1. I got way behind in my career because I decided to take the easy way out with my career and work as a chef instead of pursuing something more appropriate and related to my degree.  Cooking gave me easy access to drugs and alcohol, and also was a way more fun lifestyle than trying to get a job in finance or tech.  
    
2. I turned down a job offer to work at a data science startup after college because I didn’t feel mentally healthy enough to do it as I was drinking every day and very suicidal.  
    
3. I got very dry and couldn’t handle dealing with my girlfriend at the time so got very suicidal and was checked into a horrible psych ward.  
    
4. I used drugs and alcohol to avoid dealing with getting a job or taking my studies seriously in college.  
    
5. I put myself into physically dangerous situations as a result of my drinking, waking up in places that were new to me.  
    
6. I stayed up for a week straight and didn’t really respond to any messages or my work at the time.  
    

7. I make commitments that don’t really align with my values and spend time with people who are probably not the best influences because I want everyone to like me and I like being told what to do.  
    
8. I respond right away to text messages from my tenants, medical office etc. making it look like I’m someone who can be taken advantage of and has unlimited bandwidth to deal with problems.  
    
9. I fell 30 feet and fractured my back while extremely depressed a year into sobriety because I wasn’t able to pay attention, and felt relieved to not have to deal with coding or work during my recovery period.  
    
10. I agreed to ride the Mae Hong Song route in Chiang Mai Thailand with my best friend, even though it’s extremely dangerous and I’m not an experienced motorcycle rider.  
    
11. I voluntarily quit a job at Rubrik because I thought it would make things easier for myself and my manager.  
    
12. I decided not to purchase this apartment in the West Village because my girlfriend and parents don’t like it, even though I do.**


Insanity: 

1. Dealing with this fraudulent medical office over a bill from 2 years ago over $900
2. Dealing with frustrating tenants
3. Continuing to watch settlers of catan videos
4. Not studying quantitative trading / finance
5. Not working more on my startup
6. Doing the Mae Hong Song loop without any motorcycle training
7. Continuing to play basketball despite my arthritis
8. Keeping my money in a high yield savings account instead of learning how to invest it.  Similarly, keeping money in interactive brokers.  
9. Still pursuing a career in software engineering despite my clear issues with it.  
10. Continuing to eat unhealthily even though my father developed diabetes and I dislike being overweight
11. Not reading books or focusing on my attention.  
12. Continuing to spend my time working with alcoholics who don't show initiative.
