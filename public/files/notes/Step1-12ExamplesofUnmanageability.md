**Read step 1 in the 12 and 12, take notes, and write down 12 instances of how drugs, alcohol, or your alcoholism lead to unmanageability in your life.  

  

1. I got way behind in my career because I decided to take the easy way out with my career and work as a chef instead of pursuing something more appropriate and related to my degree.  Cooking gave me easy access to drugs and alcohol, and also was a way more fun lifestyle than trying to get a job in finance or tech.  
    
2. I turned down a job offer to work at a data science startup after college because I didn’t feel mentally healthy enough to do it as I was drinking every day and very suicidal.  
    
3. I got very dry and couldn’t handle dealing with my girlfriend at the time so got very suicidal and was checked into a horrible psych ward.  
    
4. I used drugs and alcohol to avoid dealing with getting a job or taking my studies seriously in college.  
    
5. I put myself into physically dangerous situations as a result of my drinking, waking up in places that were new to me.  
    
6. I stayed up for a week straight and didn’t really respond to any messages or my work at the time.  
    

  

(more related to my people-pleasing tendencies, perfectionism, alcoholic thinking)

  

7. I make commitments that don’t really align with my values and spend time with people who are probably not the best influences because I want everyone to like me and I like being told what to do.  
    
8. I respond right away to text messages from my tenants, medical office etc. making it look like I’m someone who can be taken advantage of and has unlimited bandwidth to deal with problems.  
    
9. I fell 30 feet and fractured my back while extremely depressed a year into sobriety because I wasn’t able to pay attention, and felt relieved to not have to deal with coding or work during my recovery period.  
    
10. I agreed to ride the Mae Hong Song route in Chiang Mai Thailand with my best friend, even though it’s extremely dangerous and I’m not an experienced motorcycle rider.  
    
11. I voluntarily quit a job at Rubrik because I thought it would make things easier for myself and my manager.  
    
12. I decided not to purchase this apartment in the West Village because my girlfriend and parents don’t like it, even though I do.**
