## üìö Fleeting Notes
Quick observations, half-baked thoughts, questions, or ideas you had while reading.

- Written in E Minor from Final Fantasy X
- One sharp F#
- Tempo: Allegro, quarter note = ~95bpm (though its often interpreted more slowly and reflectively)
- A gentle, repeating motif in the right hand accompanies simplex, expressive harmonies in the left, gradually building emotional intensity without ever losings its calm, introspective tone.

## üß† Literature Notes
Summarize what the source actually said in **your own words**. Pull in any code, math, or diagrams.

**Topic**: Context in Final Fantasy X
- To Zanarkind serves as the main theme and is first heard during the opening cutscene
- It plays again when the characters finally reach Zanarkand
- Underscores themes of memory, loss, sacrifice, and the passage of time.  
- Minimalistic: Uses repetition effectively
- Melancholic beauty: Sparse voicing evoke longing and introspection
- Stepwise motion (mostly moving by seconds, very few leaps)
- A narrow range that makes it feel intimate
- Frequent use of repeated notes and long tones
- Call and repsonse phrasing
- B-D-E-G-E-D-B-A
- D-B-A motif is a signature of the piece.  
- The left hand often arpeggiates the chords or plays broken intervals (open fifths or octaves)
- Modal interchanges
- Use of Cmaj7 adds warmth and emotional depth right after the opening Em
