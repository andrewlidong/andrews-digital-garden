# Phish

I've been to nearly 100 Phish shows since my first one on July 4th, 2012 at Jones Beach. That first show hooked me - the way they could seamlessly flow between composed sections and improvisation was unlike anything I'd experienced before.

Over the years, I've caught some legendary performances. The New Year's Eve show at Madison Square Garden when they played Gamehendge was surreal - hearing that entire story suite live is something I never thought would happen. And the recent Vegas Sphere shows with the Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma theme? The combination of their music with that venue's capabilities was mind-blowing.

I'm primarily an East Coast show-goer, but I've made the journey west a few times. Seeing them at the Greek Theater in Berkeley with that amazing backdrop was worth the trip. Merriweather Post Pavilion has become a regular stop for me too, though I have one major regret there - showing up late to a show and missing "McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters," my absolute favorite song. I've learned my lesson: never be late to a Phish show. You never know what they might play right out of the gate.

Festival experiences have been some of my best memories. Magnaball was incredible - three days of music, art installations, and that secret late-night set in the drive-in field. I had tickets for Curveball too, and was devastated when I broke my back just a week before. Finding out later that the festival was canceled due to water issues was a strange mix of disappointment and relief - at least I didn't miss anything while I was recovering.

My best friend Nick has been my concert companion for most of these shows. We've driven thousands of miles, stayed in sketchy motels, and had countless adventures chasing this band. These shared experiences have cemented our friendship in a way nothing else could.

Phish has been more than just music in my life - it's shaped my outlook. There's something about their playfulness, their willingness to take risks (even if it means failing sometimes), and the community they've fostered that's influenced how I approach life. I've learned to embrace spontaneity, find joy in the unexpected, and appreciate the beauty of imperfection.

If you've never seen them, it's hard to explain what makes it special. It's not just about the songs - it's about being present for a unique moment that will never happen exactly the same way again.
