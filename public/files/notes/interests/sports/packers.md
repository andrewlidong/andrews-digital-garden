# Green Bay Packers

Football was a constant in my childhood - those backyard games where we'd play until it was too dark to see the ball, drawing up plays in the dirt, and arguing over whether someone was actually tackled or not. When it came time to pick an NFL team to follow, I wanted something that was mine - not the Jets or Giants that everyone in New Jersey supported.

I chose the Packers for their history and community ownership. There was something appealing about a team that belonged to a small town in Wisconsin rather than some billionaire. The tradition, the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field, the cheeseheads - it all felt authentic in a way other franchises didn't.

As a Packers fan, I've been incredibly lucky with quarterbacks. Going from Brett Favre's gunslinging, never-say-die approach directly to Aaron Rodgers' surgical precision seemed almost unfair. And now Jordan Love is showing flashes of brilliance that suggest the tradition might continue. Three decades, three franchise QBs - that's rare air in the NFL.

When I first moved to New York, I discovered Mad River on the Upper East Side - a Packers bar where I could watch games surrounded by fellow cheeseheads. There's something special about finding your people in a new city, all of you decked out in green and gold while the rest of the city roots for different teams.

Made the pilgrimage to Lambeau during college - an experience every football fan should have regardless of team allegiance. The stadium itself feels like a living museum. Stocked up on cheese curds for the drive home - they didn't last long before we devoured them.
