# **📖 Chapter 1: The Real and Complex Number Systems**

### **Key Ideas**

- **The Real Number System (ℝ)**  
    The real numbers form an **ordered field**, meaning they support:
    
    - Addition and multiplication (with commutativity, associativity, and distributivity).
    - A natural order (a<ba < ba<b makes sense).
    - The **least upper bound (supremum) property**: Every non-empty set of real numbers that has an upper bound has a smallest such upper bound.
- **Why This Matters**  
    The **supremum property** is what makes the real numbers "complete." Without it, we could have gaps (like the rationals missing 2\sqrt{2}2​). This property ensures limits exist when they should.
    
- **Complex Numbers (ℂ)**  
    The complex numbers extend the real numbers by introducing iii, where:
    
    i2=−1i^2 = -1i2=−1
    
    Every complex number can be written as:
    
    z=a+biz = a + biz=a+bi
    
    Complex numbers also have a **polar form**:
    
    z=reiθ=r(cos⁡θ+isin⁡θ)z = r e^{i\theta} = r (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)z=reiθ=r(cosθ+isinθ)
    
    which leads to **Euler’s formula**:
    
    eiπ+1=0e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0eiπ+1=0
    
    This formula elegantly links exponentials, trigonometry, and the imaginary unit.

# **📖 Chapter 2: Basic Topology**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Metric Spaces**  
    A **metric space** is a set where we can measure distances using a function d(x,y)d(x, y)d(x,y) that satisfies:
    
    - **Distance is never negative**: d(x,y)≥0d(x, y) \geq 0d(x,y)≥0, with d(x,y)=0d(x, y) = 0d(x,y)=0 if and only if x=yx = yx=y.
    - **Symmetry**: d(x,y)=d(y,x)d(x, y) = d(y, x)d(x,y)=d(y,x).
    - **Triangle inequality**: The shortest path is always direct:d(x,z)≤d(x,y)+d(y,z)d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)d(x,z)≤d(x,y)+d(y,z)
- **Open and Closed Sets**
    
    - A **set is open** if for every point inside it, you can move a small amount in any direction and still be inside the set.
    - A **set is closed** if it contains all its **limit points** (points where sequences in the set can accumulate).
- **Compactness**  
    A set is **compact** if it behaves like a closed and bounded set in R\mathbb{R}R, meaning:
    
    - You can cover it with infinitely many open sets, but a **finite** number of them are enough to still cover everything.
- **Connectedness**  
    A space is **connected** if it cannot be split into two separate, non-overlapping open sets.
    
- **Why This Matters**  
    Compactness is essential because **continuous functions on compact sets always attain maximum and minimum values**, and connectedness is the reason the **Intermediate Value Theorem** works (if a function starts negative and ends positive, it must cross zero somewhere).


# **📖 Chapter 3: Numerical Sequences and Series**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Sequences and Limits**  
    A sequence is an ordered list of numbers:
    
    a1,a2,a3,…a_1, a_2, a_3, \dotsa1​,a2​,a3​,…
    
    A sequence **converges** to a limit LLL if, after a certain point, all terms get arbitrarily close to LLL.
    
- **Cauchy Sequences**  
    Instead of checking if a sequence approaches some specific limit, we can check if its terms get arbitrarily close to each other:
    
    ∣an−am∣→0 as n,m→∞.|a_n - a_m| \to 0 \text{ as } n, m \to \infty.∣an​−am​∣→0 as n,m→∞.
    
    If this holds, the sequence should **converge** in a complete space like R\mathbb{R}R.
    
- **Series and Convergence**  
    A **series** is an infinite sum of a sequence:
    
    Sn=a1+a2+a3+…S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsSn​=a1​+a2​+a3​+…
    
    Some infinite sums make sense (converge), while others grow without bound (diverge). Tests like the **ratio test** help determine which is which.
    
- **Why This Matters**  
    Many mathematical structures (like Fourier series) rely on understanding **when infinite sums behave well**.


# **📖 Chapter 4: Continuity**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Definition of Continuity**  
    A function is **continuous at a point x0x_0x0​** if small changes in xxx lead to small changes in f(x)f(x)f(x). Formally:
    
    ∀ϵ>0,∃δ>0 such that ∣x−x0∣<δ⇒∣f(x)−f(x0)∣<ϵ.\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } |x - x_0| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(x_0)| < \epsilon.∀ϵ>0,∃δ>0 such that ∣x−x0​∣<δ⇒∣f(x)−f(x0​)∣<ϵ.
- **Uniform Continuity**  
    A function is **uniformly continuous** if the choice of δ\deltaδ depends **only on ϵ\epsilonϵ and not on x0x_0x0​**.
    
- **Extreme Value Theorem**  
    If a function is continuous on a **compact** set, it must reach a maximum and a minimum.
    
- **Why This Matters**  
    Uniform continuity is much stronger than normal continuity, ensuring **functions behave predictably** even over infinite domains.

# **📖 Chapter 5: Differentiation**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Definition of the Derivative**  
    The derivative measures how a function changes at a point:
    
    f′(x)=lim⁡h→0f(x+h)−f(x)hf'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}f′(x)=h→0lim​hf(x+h)−f(x)​
- **Mean Value Theorem (MVT)**  
    If a function is continuous and differentiable, then **at some point**, its derivative equals the average rate of change:
    
    f′(c)=f(b)−f(a)b−a.f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.f′(c)=b−af(b)−f(a)​.
- **L'Hôpital’s Rule**  
    Helps evaluate limits that give indeterminate forms like 0/00/00/0 or ∞/∞\infty/\infty∞/∞:
    
    lim⁡x→af(x)g(x)=lim⁡x→af′(x)g′(x).\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.x→alim​g(x)f(x)​=x→alim​g′(x)f′(x)​.
- **Why This Matters**  
    The Mean Value Theorem justifies why **smooth functions behave predictably**, and L'Hôpital’s Rule simplifies many difficult limits.
# **📖 Chapter 6: The Riemann-Stieltjes Integral**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Generalization of the Riemann Integral**
    
    - The **Riemann integral** sums up function values over an interval, but the **Riemann-Stieltjes integral** introduces a **weighting function g(x)g(x)g(x)** that affects how the sum is accumulated:∫abf(x) dg(x)\int_a^b f(x) \, dg(x)∫ab​f(x)dg(x)
    - If g(x)=xg(x) = xg(x)=x, this **reduces to the Riemann integral**:∫abf(x) dx\int_a^b f(x) \, dx∫ab​f(x)dx
    - However, **when g(x)g(x)g(x) is more general**, it allows integration in different ways.
- **What is g(x)g(x)g(x) doing?**
    
    - g(x)g(x)g(x) can **assign more weight to certain intervals**, effectively stretching or compressing how the function is summed.
    - It allows us to integrate functions that have jumps (discontinuities) in a controlled way.
- **Conditions for Riemann-Stieltjes Integrability**
    
    - If f(x)f(x)f(x) is **continuous** and g(x)g(x)g(x) is **of bounded variation** (meaning it does not oscillate too wildly), then the integral exists.
    - This concept is crucial in **probability theory** and **stochastic processes**.

### **Why This Matters**

- The **Riemann-Stieltjes integral is a stepping stone to Lebesgue integration** (covered in Chapter 11).
- It shows up in **probability and statistics**, particularly in defining expectations for continuous distributions.

# **📖 Chapter 7: Sequences and Series of Functions**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Pointwise vs. Uniform Convergence**
    
    - A **sequence of functions** fn(x)f_n(x)fn​(x) can converge to a function f(x)f(x)f(x) in different ways:
        - **Pointwise convergence**: For each xxx, fn(x)→f(x)f_n(x) \to f(x)fn​(x)→f(x).
        - **Uniform convergence**: The rate of convergence is **uniform** across the entire domain.
    - Uniform convergence is much stronger because it ensures **continuity, differentiation, and integration behave well with limits**.
- **Weierstrass M-test**
    
    - This is a powerful tool to check **uniform convergence** by comparing function sequences to a known convergent numerical series.
- **Interchanging Limits**
    
    - If fn→ff_n \to ffn​→f uniformly, then:
        - You can **swap differentiation and limits**:lim⁡n→∞fn′(x)=f′(x)\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n'(x) = f'(x)n→∞lim​fn′​(x)=f′(x)
        - You can **swap integration and limits**:lim⁡n→∞∫fn(x)dx=∫lim⁡n→∞fn(x)dx\lim_{n\to\infty} \int f_n(x) dx = \int \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x) dxn→∞lim​∫fn​(x)dx=∫n→∞lim​fn​(x)dx
    - This is **not** always true for pointwise convergence, which is why uniform convergence is often required.

### **Why This Matters**

- Many results in **Fourier series, power series, and functional analysis** rely on uniform convergence.
- If you want to swap limits and integrals safely, uniform convergence is **key**.
# **📖 Chapter 8: Special Functions**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Power Series Representations**
    
    - Many important functions (like exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions) can be written as **infinite power series**:ex=∑n=0∞xnn!e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}ex=n=0∑∞​n!xn​
    - Power series have **radius of convergence**, meaning they only converge for certain values of xxx.
- **Gamma and Beta Functions**
    
    - The **Gamma function** generalizes factorials to non-integer values:Γ(n)=∫0∞xn−1e−xdx\Gamma(n) = \int_0^\infty x^{n-1} e^{-x} dxΓ(n)=∫0∞​xn−1e−xdx
    - The **Beta function** is closely related and appears in probability distributions.

### **Why This Matters**

- Power series are the **foundation of complex analysis**.
- The Gamma function appears in **probability theory, physics, and statistics**.

# **📖 Chapter 9: Functions of Several Variables**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Partial Derivatives and the Jacobian**
    
    - A function of several variables f(x,y)f(x, y)f(x,y) can have **partial derivatives**:∂f∂x,∂f∂y\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}∂x∂f​,∂y∂f​
    - The **Jacobian matrix** generalizes this by describing how small changes in input affect multiple output variables.
- **Implicit and Inverse Function Theorems**
    
    - These theorems tell us when we can:
        - **Solve for one variable in terms of others** (Implicit Function Theorem).
        - **Guarantee local invertibility** of a function (Inverse Function Theorem).

### **Why This Matters**

- Multivariable calculus is crucial in **physics, optimization, and machine learning**.
- The **Jacobian** is widely used in machine learning for backpropagation in neural networks.

# **📖 Chapter 10: Integration of Differential Forms**

### **Key Ideas**

    - A **differential form** is a generalization of functions and vector fields, allowing integration over **curves, surfaces, and volumes**.
    - The **exterior derivative** generalizes the gradient, divergence, and curl.
- **Stokes’ Theorem**
    
    - A **generalization of Green’s Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**:∫Ωdω=∫∂Ωω\int_{\Omega} d\omega = \int_{\partial\Omega} \omega∫Ω​dω=∫∂Ω​ω
    - It connects **flux integrals and line integrals**, unifying concepts in vector calculus.

### **Why This Matters**

- Stokes’ Theorem is **one of the most powerful results in differential geometry and physics**.
- It’s used in **electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and general relativity**.

# **📖 Chapter 11: The Lebesgue Theory**

### **Key Ideas**

- **Limitations of Riemann Integration**
    
    - The Riemann integral fails for some well-behaved functions, such as those that oscillate too much (e.g., Dirichlet’s function).
- **Lebesgue Measure and Integration**
    
    - Instead of summing up function values at fixed points, the **Lebesgue integral** groups values by their **measure**:∫f dμ\int f \, d\mu∫fdμ
    - This approach is much more powerful, allowing us to integrate functions that the Riemann integral cannot.
- **Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT)**
    
    - This is one of the most powerful theorems in real analysis, allowing us to **swap limits and integrals** under mild conditions:lim⁡n→∞∫fn dμ=∫lim⁡n→∞fn dμ\lim_{n\to\infty} \int f_n \, d\mu = \int \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n \, d\mun→∞lim​∫fn​dμ=∫n→∞lim​fn​dμ
- **LpL^pLp-spaces**
    
    - The set of functions where the **p-th power of the absolute value is integrable**:Lp={f∣∫∣f∣pdμ<∞}L^p = \{ f \mid \int |f|^p d\mu < \infty \}Lp={f∣∫∣f∣pdμ<∞}
    - These spaces form the foundation of **functional analysis and modern probability theory**.

### **Why This Matters**

- Lebesgue integration is **the standard in modern mathematics**.
- **Probability, Fourier analysis, and quantum mechanics** all rely on the Lebesgue integral.
