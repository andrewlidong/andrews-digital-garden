### **Key Ideas:**

1. **Axioms of the Real Numbers ℝ**
    
    - ℝ is an **ordered field**: It has addition, multiplication, and a well-defined ordering.
    - It satisfies the **Archimedean property** (i.e., there’s no largest natural number).
    - It has the **least upper bound (supremum) property**.
2. **Supremum and Infimum**
    
    - The **supremum** (least upper bound) is the smallest number that is **greater than or equal** to all elements of a set.
    - The **infimum** (greatest lower bound) is the largest number that is **less than or equal** to all elements of a set.
3. **Completeness of ℝ**
    
    - Every **Cauchy sequence** (a sequence where terms get arbitrarily close) **converges in ℝ**.
    - **Why is this important?** Because not all number systems have this property! For example, the rational numbers ℚ are not complete—there exist Cauchy sequences in ℚ that don’t converge within ℚ (like sequences approaching √2).
4. **Construction of ℝ from ℚ**
    
    - Real numbers can be rigorously **constructed from rational numbers** using **Dedekind cuts** or **Cauchy sequences**.
5. **Complex Numbers ℂ**
    
    - ℂ extends ℝ by adding **imaginary numbers**, defined by i2=−1i^2 = -1i2=−1.
    - Complex numbers can be written in **polar form**:z=reiθ=r(cos⁡θ+isin⁡θ)z = r e^{i\theta} = r (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)z=reiθ=r(cosθ+isinθ)
    - This leads to **Euler’s formula**:eiπ+1=0e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0eiπ+1=0which is one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics.

## **📖 Chapter 2: Basic Topology**

### **Key Ideas:**

1. **Metric Spaces**
    
    - A **metric space** is a set XXX with a function (metric) d(x,y)d(x,y)d(x,y) that measures distances.
    - It satisfies:
        - **Non-negativity**: d(x,y)≥0d(x, y) \geq 0d(x,y)≥0, and d(x,y)=0d(x, y) = 0d(x,y)=0 if and only if x=yx = yx=y.
        - **Symmetry**: d(x,y)=d(y,x)d(x, y) = d(y, x)d(x,y)=d(y,x).
        - **Triangle inequality**: d(x,z)≤d(x,y)+d(y,z)d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)d(x,z)≤d(x,y)+d(y,z).
2. **Open and Closed Sets**
    
    - A **set is open** if for every point xxx in the set, there is an ϵ\epsilonϵ-ball around xxx that stays in the set.
    - A **set is closed** if it contains all of its **limit points**.
3. **Compactness**
    
    - A set is **compact** if every open cover has a **finite subcover**.
    - **Heine-Borel Theorem**: A subset of ℝⁿ is compact **if and only if it is closed and bounded**.
4. **Connectedness**
    
    - A space is **connected** if it **cannot be divided into two disjoint open sets**.
    - **Intermediate Value Theorem**: If a function is continuous on a connected space, it takes on all values between its extremes.

## **📖 Chapter 3: Numerical Sequences and Series**

### **Key Ideas:**

1. **Sequences and Limits**
    
    - A sequence {an}\{a_n\}{an​} **converges to LLL** if:∀ϵ>0,∃N such that n≥N⇒∣an−L∣<ϵ.\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N \text{ such that } n \geq N \Rightarrow |a_n - L| < \epsilon.∀ϵ>0,∃N such that n≥N⇒∣an​−L∣<ϵ.
    - **Cauchy sequences**: A sequence is Cauchy if its terms get arbitrarily close to each other.
2. **Series and Convergence Tests**
    
    - A **series** is a sum of a sequence:Sn=a1+a2+a3+…S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dotsSn​=a1​+a2​+a3​+…
    - **Convergence tests**:
        - **Comparison test**: Compare to a known convergent/divergent series.
        - **Ratio test**: If lim sup⁡∣an+1/an∣<1\limsup |a_{n+1}/a_n| < 1limsup∣an+1​/an​∣<1, the series converges.
        - **Root test**: If lim sup⁡∣an∣n<1\limsup \sqrt[n]{|a_n|} < 1limsupn∣an​∣​<1, the series converges.
## **📖 Chapter 4: Continuity**

### **Key Ideas:**

1. **ε-δ Definition of Continuity**
    
    - A function fff is **continuous at x0x_0x0​** if:∀ϵ>0,∃δ>0 such that ∣x−x0∣<δ⇒∣f(x)−f(x0)∣<ϵ.\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } |x - x_0| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(x_0)| < \epsilon.∀ϵ>0,∃δ>0 such that ∣x−x0​∣<δ⇒∣f(x)−f(x0​)∣<ϵ.
2. **Uniform Continuity**
    
    - A function is **uniformly continuous** if the choice of δ\deltaδ depends only on ϵ\epsilonϵ, not on x0x_0x0​.
3. **Extreme Value Theorem**
    
    - A continuous function on a **compact set** attains a maximum and minimum.


## **📖 Chapter 5: Differentiation**

### **Key Ideas:**

1. **Derivative Definition**
    
    f′(x)=lim⁡h→0f(x+h)−f(x)hf'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}f′(x)=h→0lim​hf(x+h)−f(x)​
2. **Mean Value Theorem (MVT)**
    
    - If f(x)f(x)f(x) is continuous on [a,b][a,b][a,b] and differentiable on (a,b)(a,b)(a,b), there exists some ccc such that:f′(c)=f(b)−f(a)b−af'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}f′(c)=b−af(b)−f(a)​
    - This is the foundation for **Taylor Series, L'Hôpital's Rule, and convexity analysis**.
