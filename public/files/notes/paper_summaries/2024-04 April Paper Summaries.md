Meetup 009 - Understanding the Mirai Botnet (April 3, 2024)
- This paper provides a detailed analysis of Mirai, the IoT botnet responsible for massive DDoS attacks by exploiting insecure internet-connected devices.  It covers Mirai's infection strategies, propogation mechanisms, and botnet control infrastructure.  The paper also discusses post-attack mitigation efforts and the broader implications for IoT security.  

Meetup 010 - Dynamic Instrumentation of Production Systems | DTrace
- DTrace is a powerful dynamic tracing framework for debugging and profiling production systems in real time.  It allows low-overhead instrumentation of kernel and user-space programs without modifying source code.  The paper outlines DTrace's architecture, which uses safe, programmable probes to monitor system behavior, making it invaluable for performance analysis and debugging in complex, high-availability environments. 

Meetup 011 - Maglev: A Fast and Reliable Software Network Load Balancer
- Maglev is a high-performance software-based network load balancer developed by Google.  Unlike traditional hardware load balancers, Maglev uses consistent hashing with connection tracking to ensure reliable, evenly distributed load balancing across backend servers.  The paper discusses its design principles, optimizations for packet processing speed, and how it achieves near line-rate performance on commodity hardware.
