## üìö Fleeting Notes
Quick observations, half-baked thoughts, questions, or ideas you had while reading.

- V8's execution pipeline
- Parsing: reads your jS code and turns it into an abstract syntax tree
- Interpreter (Ignition): The AST gets translated into bytecode (a lower-level version of JS) by the interpreter called Ignition
- Profiler: While running the code, V8 watches for "hot functions" (frequently-used ones)
- Compiler (TurboFan) For hot code, V8 sends the bytecode to TurboFan, a Just-In-Time compiler that turns it into fast, optimized machine code
- Garbage Collection: V8 includes a garbage collector to clean up memory that's no longer used, mostly for objects no longer referenced.

## üß† Literature Notes
Summarize what the source actually said in **your own words**. Pull in any code, math, or diagrams.

**Topic**: Key Components
- Ignition: The interpreter - fast startup, lower memory usage
- TurboFan: The JIT optimizing compiler - speeds up hot code
- Orinoco: The parallel garbage collector
- Liftoff & TurboFan (for WebAssembly) WebAssembly compilation

**Topic**: Why V8 is Fast
- Uses **hidden classes** and **inline caches** to guess and remember what types your JS variables are.
    
- **Optimizes functions** if they behave consistently (like using numbers for `a + b` every time).
    
- If assumptions break (you start passing a string), it **de-optimizes** that function and reverts to slower code.

**Topic**: Where you've seen V8 in Action
- **Google Chrome**: powers all JS execution.
    
- **Node.js**: runs JS outside the browser.
    
- **Deno**: a newer Node-like runtime.
    
- **Bun**: Uses Zig + JavaScript and was originally based on JavaScriptCore, not V8, but competes in the same space.

**Topic**: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

An **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** is a tree representation of the **syntactic structure** of source code, abstracted from its actual syntax. Each node in the tree represents a construct occurring in the code‚Äîlike a variable, function, loop, or expression.

Because it **ignores superficial syntax** details (like parentheses, semicolons, or indentation) and **focuses on the meaningful structure** of the code. It's not a direct mapping of the text, but a logical model of the program's structure.

### Common Uses of ASTs

- **Compilers & Interpreters**: ASTs are an intermediate step between parsing code and generating machine code.
    
- **Static Analysis Tools**: Linting, type checking, code optimization.
    
- **Code Transformation**: Tools like Babel (JavaScript), Black (Python), or refactoring engines.
    
- **Security Analysis**: Detecting vulnerable patterns or malicious code.

**Topic**: Hot Code
- **Hot code path**: This is the part of a program that gets run the most, like tight loops, inner computations, or critical request handlers.
    
- Why it matters: Optimizing hot code can significantly speed up your application because it runs so often.
    
- Example: If you‚Äôre profiling a web app and see that 80% of CPU time is spent in one function, that function is "hot."

- **Hot code** is code that the virtual machine notices is being run a lot and decides to **optimize on the fly**, often via **JIT compilation** (Just-In-Time).
    
- Some platforms even **replace cold code with hot code dynamically** without restarting‚Äîthis is called **hot code swapping**.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è In Systems like Erlang / Elixir:

- **Hot code swapping** allows you to load a new version of a module without stopping the system.
    
- Useful in high-availability systems like telecoms or distributed apps where downtime isn't acceptable.

**Topic**: Web Assembly

WebAssembly (often abbreviated **Wasm**) is a low-level binary instruction format designed to run code on the web at near-native speed. It was created to enable high-performance applications (like games, video editing, CAD tools, etc.) to run in web browsers, but it's now being used in many other environments too.

### üß† **What is it, really?**

- **A binary format**: It's not human-readable like JavaScript ‚Äî it's compact and fast to load.
    
- **A virtual machine target**: You can compile code written in languages like C, C++, or Rust to WebAssembly, and then run that compiled code in a web browser.
    
- **Safe and sandboxed**: Runs in a secure, controlled environment like JavaScript does.### üåê **Why is WebAssembly cool?**

- **Performance**: It runs faster than JavaScript because it‚Äôs closer to machine code.
    
- **Portability**: It works across all major browsers and operating systems.
    
- **Language flexibility**: You‚Äôre not limited to JavaScript ‚Äî you can write in Rust, C++, Go, etc.
    
- **Runs outside the browser too**: Thanks to projects like [WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) (WebAssembly System Interface), it‚Äôs becoming a general-purpose runtime.
    
### ü§ù WebAssembly & JavaScript

WebAssembly doesn‚Äôt replace JavaScript ‚Äî it **complements** it. You can:

- Call WebAssembly functions from JavaScript
    
- Share memory between the two
    
- Use WebAssembly to handle heavy computations and let JavaScript manage UI and event handling
---

### üß™ Use cases

- Running **graphics-heavy apps** (e.g. Unity or Unreal Engine games)
    
- Porting legacy **C/C++ desktop software** to the web (e.g. AutoCAD, Figma)
    
- Speeding up parts of your web app (e.g. a video encoder or audio processor)
    
- Running Python or other languages **in the browser**
