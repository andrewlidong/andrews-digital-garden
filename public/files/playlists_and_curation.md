# Playlists & Curation

## The Art of Musical Storytelling

Creating playlists has become a form of personal expression and storytelling for me. I find joy in carefully selecting and sequencing tracks to create cohesive musical journeys that capture specific moods, themes, or moments in time.

### The Curation Philosophy

My approach to playlist creation involves:

- Thoughtful sequencing that creates a natural flow between tracks
- Attention to tonal and emotional transitions
- Thematic coherence while maintaining variety
- Balancing familiar favorites with discoveries
- Creating an overall arc that takes the listener on a journey

### Featured Playlists

Some of my carefully crafted playlists include:

- [Jangle All the Way](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/jangle-all-the-way/pl.u-PDb42NEtNVDlb6) - Bright, jangly guitars and upbeat indie pop
- [End of the Party](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/end-of-the-party/pl.u-Zmbl3qjsvPeNMD) - Melancholic tracks for late-night reflection
- [Post-Punk Revival](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/post-punk-revival/pl.u-Ymb0D5yUjb8A5y) - Angular guitars and driving rhythms from the post-punk scene
- [Do the D.A.N.C.E](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/do-the-d-a-n-c-e/pl.u-AkAmz5GTpLJ19A) - Infectious dance tracks that get you moving
- [Cigarette in the rain](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/cigarette-in-the-rain/pl.u-AkAmMdNipLJ19A) - Atmospheric and moody soundscapes

### Playlist Types

I create different kinds of playlists for various purposes:

- **Mood-Based** - Capturing specific emotional states or atmospheres
- **Genre Explorations** - Deep dives into particular styles or scenes
- **Seasonal Collections** - Music that embodies the feeling of specific times of year
- **Activity Soundtracks** - Curated for specific contexts like studying, traveling, or exercising
- **Narrative Journeys** - Telling a story through song selection and sequencing

### The Discovery Process

Finding new music to incorporate into playlists is an ongoing adventure:

- Exploring artist discographies and related acts
- Following recommendations from trusted sources
- Diving into genre-specific communities and forums
- Attending shows and discovering opening acts
- Using algorithms as starting points for human curation

### Sharing and Connection

Playlists have become a way to connect with others through music:

- Creating personalized playlists as gifts for friends
- Sharing discoveries with like-minded music enthusiasts
- Using playlists to introduce others to new genres or artists
- Collaborative playlist creation with friends
- Documenting musical moments and memories

### The Digital Crate Dig

In the streaming era, I approach playlist curation as a modern form of crate digging:

- Seeking out overlooked gems and forgotten classics
- Connecting threads between disparate artists and eras
- Preserving and highlighting music that might otherwise be missed
- Creating context through thoughtful juxtaposition
- Building collections that reflect personal taste while expanding horizons
