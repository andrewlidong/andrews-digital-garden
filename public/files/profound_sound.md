### Development Process
Profound Sound was developed to bridge the gap between professional music production tools and AI capabilities. The project began with research into music theory algorithms and machine learning models for audio processing.

The backend is built with Python and Flask, with TensorFlow powering the AI components. The system was trained on thousands of songs across various genres to understand musical patterns, chord progressions, and production techniques.

The frontend utilizes React and the Web Audio API to create a responsive and intuitive interface for musicians. Special attention was paid to creating a workflow that feels natural to both beginners and experienced producers, with AI suggestions that enhance creativity rather than replacing it.

One of the most challenging aspects was implementing real-time audio processing with low latency, which required optimization of both the frontend and backend components. The collaborative features allow multiple musicians to work on the same project simultaneously, with changes syncing in real-time.
