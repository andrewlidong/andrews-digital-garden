# Catch That Qubit

## Quantum Computing-Based Pokémon Safari Game

A quantum computing-based Pokémon Safari Zone game that uses Grover's Algorithm to search for Pokémon, demonstrating quantum search concepts through an interactive game interface.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Qiskit
- NumPy

### Features
- Quantum search using Grover's Algorithm
- Real-time quantum circuit simulation
- Probability-based catching mechanics
- Score tracking and Pokémon collection
- Beautiful web interface

### Development Process
Catch That Qubit was developed to demonstrate quantum computing concepts in an engaging and interactive way. The game uses Grover's Algorithm to search for Pokémon in a quantum state space, making quantum computing concepts more accessible through gameplay.

The backend is built with Flask and uses Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation. The game achieves approximately 96% theoretical success rate with optimal iterations of Grover's Algorithm, demonstrating the power of quantum search algorithms.
