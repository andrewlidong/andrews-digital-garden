# Monge's Theorem

## Interactive Geometric Visualization

A visualization of Monge's theorem using React and Canvas, demonstrating that for any three circles in a plane, none of which is completely inside another, the intersection points of their external tangent lines are collinear.

### Technologies Used
- TypeScript
- React
- Canvas
- Vite

### Features
- Interactive circle manipulation
- Real-time tangent line calculation
- Dynamic collinearity visualization
- Smooth animations
- Responsive design

### Development Process
This project was created to provide an interactive and intuitive understanding of Monge's Theorem, a beautiful result in projective geometry. The visualization allows users to manipulate three circles in a plane and observe how their external tangent lines' intersection points always remain collinear.

The implementation uses React for the UI components and Canvas for the geometric rendering. Special attention was paid to performance optimization to ensure smooth animations and real-time updates as users interact with the circles.

### Key Technical Achievements
- Implemented efficient geometric calculations
- Created smooth circle dragging interactions
- Developed real-time tangent line computation
- Built dynamic collinearity checking
- Designed an intuitive user interface
