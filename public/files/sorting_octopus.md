### Development Process
Sorting Octopus was born from a desire to create a fun, community-building tool for the Recurse Center. The project leverages the Phoenix framework for real-time communication and Elixir's concurrency model to handle multiple conversations simultaneously.

The core of the application is powered by GPT-3.5, which analyzes user responses to determine the most suitable Hogwarts house based on programming interests, problem-solving approaches, and personality traits. The system was fine-tuned with data from Recurse Center alumni to better understand the correlation between programming styles and Hogwarts houses.

The frontend is built with JavaScript, providing a clean and responsive interface that mimics a natural conversation. The design is inspired by both terminal interfaces and magical themes to create an engaging experience.
