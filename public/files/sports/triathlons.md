# Triathlons

My triathlon journey started in college when I decided, in typical fashion, to jump straight into a half Ironman without working my way up through shorter distances first. Looking back, it was a bit crazy, but that's how I tend to approach challenges.

I was completely broke at the time, attempting the race on a hybrid bike that was comically inadequate for the 56-mile ride. The night before the race, a fellow competitor noticed my setup at the transition area and actually bought me dinner, saying he could tell I needed the calories more than he needed the twenty bucks. That random act of kindness from a complete stranger is something I've never forgotten.

After a long hiatus, I got back into triathlons post-COVID with my friend Walter. We trained together for months and completed another half Ironman. Having someone to share those early morning training sessions and race-day nerves made the experience completely different.

Running has always been the most challenging discipline for me due to persistent knee injuries. I've had to modify my training and expectations around what my body can handle. But this limitation led me to develop a deeper appreciation for swimming and cycling.

Swimming has become a constant in my life. I've found masters swim clubs both in Alameda when I lived in the Bay Area and now in New York. Currently, I swim with the Equinox team here, which provides both structure and community. There's something meditative about early morning laps that centers me for the day.

Cycling evolved from a triathlon discipline to my primary mode of transportation around New York. I love the efficiency and freedom of navigating the city on two wheels. My favorite cycling experience was a backroads trip through Vermont, pedaling from town to town through rolling hills and stopping at small inns along the way. The combination of physical challenge and beautiful scenery was perfect.

I may never complete a full Ironman due to my knees, but I've found my own balance - focusing on open water swimming events and longer bike rides while keeping running to a minimum. It's taught me to work with my body's limitations rather than fighting against them.

The variety keeps it interesting. Tired of running? Bike. Bored with biking? Swim. Works different muscles, keeps training fresh.
