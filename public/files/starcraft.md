# StarCraft

My StarCraft journey peaked in college when I hit Diamond rank - not pro level by any means, but respectable enough that I was invited to coach the UChicago StarCraft team. Helping other players improve their game was surprisingly rewarding, especially seeing them implement strategies we'd practiced and pull off wins.

I climbed the ladder primarily as Zerg. There's something satisfying about the macro-heavy style - injecting larvae, spreading creep, and eventually overwhelming opponents with waves of units. The multitasking clicked with how my brain works.

Eventually, I switched to playing Random. The competitive drive took a backseat to just enjoying the game more holistically. There's a different kind of fun in adapting to whatever race you roll, and it kept the game fresh when I might have otherwise burned out.

These days, I find myself drawn more to Brood War than SC2. There's a beautiful jankiness to the original - the quirky pathing, the 12-unit selection limit, the worker inefficiency. All these "flaws" actually create more interesting gameplay decisions. The variance in Brood War matches feels higher, with more room for creative problem-solving rather than executing optimized build orders.

I still follow the pro scene, though not as religiously as before. Jaedong's mechanical precision was always mesmerizing to watch - his mutalisk micro in particular was art in motion. soO's persistence through all those second-place finishes before finally winning a championship made him impossible not to root for. And PartinG with his "Big Boy" zealot plays brought so much personality to his matches.

StarCraft taught me more about improvement, strategic thinking, and performance under pressure than any other game. The lessons about managing resources, making decisions with incomplete information, and recovering from setbacks have applications well beyond gaming.
